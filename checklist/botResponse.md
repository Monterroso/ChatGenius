## Checklist for Bot That Sends Messages on Behalf of Offline or Away Users

1. Enable pgvector in Supabase
   - Ensure your PostgreSQL instance on Supabase supports the pgvector extension.
   - Create or modify a “message_embeddings” table to hold vector embeddings.

2. Prepare “messages” Table
   - Add fields to store sender, receiver, content, and timestamps (you most likely have this already).

3. Create “message_embeddings” Table
   - Include:
     • id (primary key)  
     • message_id (references the messages table)  
     • embedding (vector(...) data type)  
     • metadata fields (such as sender_id, receiver_id, timestamp, etc.)  
     • created_at for record insertion time

4. Set Up the Vector Store in the Code
   - Use “@supabase/supabase-js” to connect to your Supabase database.
   - In your application code, initialize a LangChain SupabaseVectorStore (or your custom version) pointing to the “message_embeddings” table.

5. Insert Embeddings on Message Creation
   - In your "POST /api/messages" route:
     1. Insert the new message into the “messages” table.
     2. Generate an embedding of the message content (using your chosen embedding model).
     3. Insert a record into the “message_embeddings” table:
        • embedding data  
        • metadata such as sender_id, receiver_id, timestamp  
        • ID referencing the newly inserted message

6. Detect Away/Offline Status
   - Integrate with your status system (e.g., the “user_status” table).
   - When the intended recipient’s status is “away” or “offline,” trigger the bot flow instead of delivering directly to the user.

7. Retrieve Relevant Past Messages
   - Use “vectorStore.similaritySearch(query, k, filter)” or similar in LangChain to find semantically relevant past messages.  
   - The query would include the current inbound message.  
   - Filter by user_id or conversation context so you only retrieve relevant user history.

8. Generate a Response in the User’s Style
   - Pass the retrieved messages as context into an LLM prompt.
   - Indicate in your system prompt that the bot should mimic the user’s style based on these examples.
   - Generate the text that approximates what the offline user would say.

9. Label the Message as Bot-Sent
   - Insert the generated message into “messages” and “message_embeddings,” but mark an extra metadata field indicating:
     • role = "bot" or "assistant"  
     • Possibly an attribute like “bot_generated = true” for clarity.

10. Display the Bot Message in the Chat
    - Frontend should show the message as if from the user but with a small “sent by bot” tagline.
    - This can be a subtle UI distinction, such as an icon or label.

X 11. Create a Re-Verification Mechanism (Optional)
    - Optionally, let the offline user see the conversation later and confirm or revise the bot-sent messages for accuracy.

X 12. Test the Full Workflow
    - Test sending messages to someone who is away or offline.
    - Confirm the bot automatically responds in the user’s style.
    - Verify that the newly inserted embeddings and metadata are stored in the “message_embeddings” table.

X 13. Security and Privacy Considerations
    - Ensure private conversation embeddings are only used where appropriate.
    - Do not leak embeddings or content to unauthorized users.

X 14. Deploy and Monitor
    - Deploy your updated service to production (Supabase, Next.js, etc.).
    - Monitor performance and tune embedding retrieval (e.g., adjusting the “k” neighbors, indexing strategies).

This sequence will guide you through creating a retrieval-augmented generation system that mimics an offline user’s communication style via stored message embeddings in Supabase.

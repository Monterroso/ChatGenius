1. Database Migration
   • Create a new migration file (e.g., "011_store_files_in_db.sql") in your migrations folder.
   • Add a new column to the "files" table for storing the file contents in a BYTEA (or large object) column. Example:
     ALTER TABLE files
     ADD COLUMN file_data BYTEA;
   • (Optional) Remove or mark as unused the "filepath" column if you won’t store files on disk anymore.
   • Update any existing records or constraints as needed.

2. Update Upload Route (app/api/files/upload/route.ts)
   • Instead of writing the file to disk, read the file’s data as a buffer:
       const buffer = Buffer.from(await file.arrayBuffer());
   • Insert the raw binary data into the "files" table’s BYTEA column:
       INSERT INTO files (group_id, uploader_id, filename, filetype, filesize, file_data, ...)
   • Remove or replace any logic dealing with “filepath,” since you won’t need to join paths or write to the filesystem.

3. Update Download Route (app/api/files/[id]/download/route.ts)
   • Query the "files" table and retrieve the BYTEA column for the file instead of reading from the filesystem.
   • Return a NextResponse with the file’s binary data.
     Example:
       const fileBuffer = row.file_data;
       const response = new NextResponse(fileBuffer);
       response.headers.set('Content-Type', row.filetype);
       ...
   • Remove any references to local disk-based reads.

4. Update Other File Endpoints (app/api/files/[id]/route.ts)
   • When returning metadata about a file, remove or replace references to “filepath.”
   • For deletion, remove the file data from the database rather than calling “unlink.”

5. Frontend Adjustments
   • File Upload:
     - Remove references to the file path in “FileUpload.” You’ll still post the File object via FormData.
     - The server route will now handle storing the file’s data in the database.
   • File Download:
     - Update download links to point to your new route:
         /api/files/[id]/download
       (This should already be correct, but now it returns DB data.)
     - The user’s browser will receive a downloaded file from memory instead of a disk path.

6. Testing & Validation
   • Verify that you can upload files up to your size limit without issues.
   • Confirm that you can download the same file, and it opens correctly in the browser or a local application.
   • Test any old records or references that used “filepath” to ensure they don’t break.

7. Performance & Storage Considerations
   • Monitor database size; storing files in DB can grow it quickly.
   • Consider database backups and how large file data might affect them.
   • Ensure any indexing or searching needs are addressed (though typically you wouldn’t index large BYTEA columns).

8. Cleanup
   • Remove or comment out the “public/uploads” folder usage if it’s no longer needed.
   • Update documentation (e.g., README or code comments) for the new approach to file storage.
   • Check that existing code references to “filepath” or “UPLOAD_DIR” are removed or updated.

By following these steps and verifying each piece, you’ll neatly transition from disk-based storage to storing files directly in your PostgreSQL database.

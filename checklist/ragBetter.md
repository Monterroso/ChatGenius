Below is a broad outline of the process and the steps you’ll need to implement so your auto-response bot can closely mimic the user (i.e., respond “exactly like the user should”) by leveraging a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) pipeline.
---
1. Store Rich Message Data and Metadata
• Keep storing all user messages in a “messages” table. However, be sure to include as much context as possible in each row:
– sender_id, receiver_id, sender_type, receiver_type
– group_id (if any)
– timestamp (created_at)
– content (the message text)
– Additional flags (e.g., is_automated_response, is_error, original_message_id, etc.)
• Provide the necessary metadata so that your embeddings and RAG system can filter or retrieve messages accurately (e.g., by sender, group, etc.).
---
2. Generate Embeddings for Each User Message
• On message creation/ingestion, create an embedding for the message:
• Store all relevant fields in the metadata object:
– sender_id, receiver_id, group_id
– timestamp
– Possibly is_automated_response or original_message_id
• This ensures the RAG pipeline can find messages even if they don’t have super-high similarity scores, but do match the correct user or conversation context.
---
3. Maintain a VectorStore to Search Past Messages
• Use your existing PostgreSQLVectorStore (or whichever you prefer) to store these embeddings.
• For new messages, insert them via something like:
• Periodically re-index or ensure all new messages are added to the indexing pipeline.
---
4. Expand the Retrieval Step to Fetch Style Examples
• When the bot is about to respond on behalf of the user, retrieve historical user messages (and possibly group context):
• As you mentioned, “use messages even if there isn’t a high similarity score.” You can:
– Increase the number of results requested (k = 10 or 15)
– Possibly override similarity thresholds in your code to allow more “less-similar” messages into the final set
---
5. Format Retrieved Messages for the LLM
• Convert all these retrieved user messages into a format that captures the user’s style and context:
• In your auto-response scenario, you want to treat these historical “user” messages precisely as examples of the user’s tone/voice. Doing so in the prompt helps the LLM generate a style-consistent response.
---
6. Provide Clear Instructions in the Prompt
• In your chain templates (see your qaTemplate, etc.), instruct the LLM with something like:
“You are generating a response on behalf of the user. The user typically writes like the messages in the ‘Previous Conversation.’ Mimic their grammar, brevity, tone, and style as shown in these messages.”
• You may even choose to add a separate “style analysis” step. For instance, you could parse the user’s historical messages to glean patterns (common words, average sentence length, punctuation usage) and feed that into the final prompt. For example:
“The user’s style frequently includes very short messages, no punctuation, and informal slang. Use that style.”
---
7. Combine Relevant Messages + Style Examples for Final Response
• In the function that processes the auto-response, gather:
– The user’s last message that triggered the auto-response
– K “similar” or relevant user messages from the vector store (with some lenient filter)
– Possibly the user’s last 10 messages from across the system (recent history)
• Combine them all in your RAG step to form the final context. Example:
• The LLM sees many real user examples, then tries to match that style.
---
8. Store and Mark the Final Automated Response
• Once the LLM returns a response, store it in “messages” just like any other message, but set:
– sender_id = userId
– is_automated_response = true (or a similar boolean)
• Also embed this final message (using createEmbedding, etc.) so it can be retrieved just like any other user message.
---
9. End-to-End Flow Summary
User’s last message arrives ⇒ generate + store embedding.
Check if we need an auto-response (the user is away/offline).
If yes, gather relevant user messages from the last 7+ days (or more) plus vector store “similar” messages.
Format them (style examples + conversation context).
Instruct the LLM to keep the user’s style.
Get response, store as if from the user, mark as automated.
Embed and store that new auto-response as well.
Following these steps will help ensure the bot can respond in a way that truly reflects how that particular user typically writes. You can further improve the style matching by analyzing average word count, punctuation, and so on, then passing that as additional instructions in your prompt.
---
This approach leverages the existing message embeddings, the VectorStore for retrieval, and the LLM’s chain to combine knowledge with user style data. Adjust your similarity threshold or results count (k) to ensure you retrieve enough user messages even if the similarity score is not high. Implementing these steps thoroughly should yield the “user-like” auto-response experience you’re aiming for.
